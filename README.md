# Tweet_endomondo
The goal of the program is to find all words marked with "#Endomondo". Of course, the program can also search for other keywords. From tweets downloaded in this way, we collect all the most necessary information, i.e. geographical coordinates, type of sport. Everything else is not made public in this project. To be able to use this code, you must have your own API access key.
